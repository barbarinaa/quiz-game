## quiz-game
This mini project was created as a part of the "Learn to Code in Python 3: Programming beginner to advanced" Udemy course. 
It makes the HTTP request to the Open Trivia API to retrieve a new(random) question for the each quiz round.

With this mini game I gained better understanding of HTTP requests and the process of retrieving the information from the APIs.

## Installation
Clone the repo. This is a console app so run it from the console and enjoy the quizz :)
